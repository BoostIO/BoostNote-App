## Development

Currently, we provide the frontend source code only so you cannot host our backend server by yourself.
But you can participate in development via mock backend mode. Although it still doesn't cover every API yet, you can access the basic folder and document management.

### How to run the app

Create .env file.

```sh
MOCK_BACKEND=true
BOOST_HUB_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3004
```

Run webpack processors. You have to run them in separate terminals.

```sh
npm run dev:cloud
# You can skip next two scripts if you don't need to run electron app.
npm run dev:electron
npm run dev:webpack
```

### How to extend mock backend

When the mode is enabled, all API calls will be passed to `src/cloud/api/mock/mockHandler.ts`.

The source code is quite similar to a router interface. All you need to is `method`, `pathname` and a handler function. So, when you confront `Not Found` error while calling `GET /api/something`, you can simply add a mock route like below.

```ts
{
  method: 'get',
  pathname: 'api/something',
  handler: ({ search }): GetSomethingResponse => {
    return {
      ...something
    }
  },
}
```
